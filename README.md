# used-cars-price-prediction
A straightforward  project for building a simple predictive model to used cars price using a Kaggle database. Good practice for DataScience regression projects.

In this project, there are two different Jupyter Notebook files.

1. data-etl.ipynb: uncovers the factors that affect used car prices, analyzing numerical and categorical variables separately and with the appropriate techniques for each case (correlation for numerical variables and ANOVA for categorical features).

2. models.ipynb: present a XGBoost regression model with a cross-validation step achieving a 0.8816 R-squared coefficient.

The data is available in the data folder and can be alternatively found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/uncovering-factors-that-affect-used-car-prices).
